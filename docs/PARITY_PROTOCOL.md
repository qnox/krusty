# krusty → kotlinc parity protocol

Goal (session directive): finish the Kotlin→JVM compiler rewrite in Rust as a **drop-in replacement for
kotlinc**. No compiler-plugin/extension support; every other compiler part must work. The produced
**bytecode must equal** the reference kotlinc's. Validate against the conformance tests in
`~/external-projects/kotlin`. Maintain our own test suite. Commit + push after each phase. Keep test
execution **< 60s** (profile/optimize otherwise). No hacks/workarounds/bails. TDD.

## Definitions of done

- **Runtime correctness**: `box()=="OK"` under `-Xverify:all` on the codegen/box corpus (the `kotlin`
  repo's `compiler/testData/codegen/box`). Current gate: **1361 OK / 0 FAIL** (scanned 7351).
- **Bytecode parity**: per-class `javap -c -p` normalized-equal vs kotlinc (`src/bin/bytediff.rs`).
  Normalization removes only semantics-preserving noise (source banner, instruction offsets,
  constant-pool index tokens). This is the harder bar the goal now demands.

## Tooling

- Conformance gate: `cargo test --test kotlin_box_ir_jvm_conformance --profile gate` (box()=OK, FAIL=0).
- Bytecode diff: `cargo run --release --bin bytediff -- <box_dir> [limit] [--samples]` with
  `KRUSTY_KOTLINC` (`.kotlinc/2.4.0/kotlinc/bin/kotlinc`), `KRUSTY_SURVEY_STDLIB`,
  `KRUSTY_SURVEY_JDK_MODULES` (`$JAVA_HOME/lib/modules`), `JAVA_HOME`.
- Reference repo: `~/external-projects/kotlin` (5.6G full Kotlin source; box corpus mirrored under
  `.kotlin-box/<ver>/compiler/testData/codegen/box`).

## Constraints / open items

- **Test time < 60s** — posture: the correctness gate is already <60s; the full `cargo test` is not, by
  design.
  - Fast tier (the dev/pre-merge gate): `cargo test --test kotlin_box_ir_jvm_conformance --profile gate`
    = **~38s** (rayon-parallel, ONE persistent JVM runner per thread, ClassLoader+reflection — no
    per-test JVM/javac). Plus lib unit tests (~0.02s). Under 60s. ✓
  - **Compile-once differential tests (P7, supersedes the P6 golden cache)**: golden files would go
    STALE across kotlinc versions/extensions (different output each version), so we generate the
    reference FRESH but BATCHED — every differential case's source is compiled in ONE kotlinc invocation
    (and one krusty invocation), cached per test process (`diff_refs`, `OnceLock`); each `#[test]` is
    `assert_diff("<case>")`. Add a case to `diff_cases()` (unique filename → unique facade). One kotlinc
    JVM launch for the whole `bytecode_parity_e2e` differential set instead of one-per-test:
    ~47s → **9.9s** (21 tests). No committed goldens. Other kotlinc-spawning files (`diff_kotlinc`,
    `diagnostics_match_kotlinc`, …) can adopt the same one-shot batch — follow-up.
  - **Persistent JVM box-runner for the execution e2e (P8 — IN PROGRESS).** The execution e2e used to
    spawn the krusty BINARY + `javac` + `java` PER TEST (3 process launches, 2 JVM cold-starts). The fix
    (the path this protocol named): a shared `tests/common` helper `compile_and_run_box(src, stem,
    cp_jars, jdk_modules)` that compiles IN-PROCESS (`compile_in_process`) and runs `box()` on a
    PERSISTENT JVM subprocess (`BoxRunner`, the conformance gate's pattern: bytes over stdin →
    ClassLoader+reflection → result, `poll(2)` deadline). One JVM per (test-binary, classpath), reused
    across every `#[test]` in that binary. CONVERTED so far (24 files, all green): `short_circuit`,
    `destructure`, `generic_fn`, `finally`, `class_body`, `vararg`, `try_catch`, `throw`, `safe_call`,
    `lambda`, `inheritance`, `companion`, `data_copy`, `property_accessor`, `not_null_assert`,
    `extension_fun`, `do_while`, `diverging_init`, `default_args_member`, `computed_prop`, `callable_ref`,
    `break_continue`, `range_step`, `secondary_ctor_noprimary`. NOT converted (need machinery the helper
    doesn't model — follow-up): `suspend_e2e` (36 tests, separate workstream), `top_level_property`
    (`main()`, not `box()`), `inline_splice` (real-kotlinc cross-module + raw-bytes asserts), `java_instance`
    (javac-built aux class dir on cp), `feature_box`/`box_vendored` (multi-snippet custom harness),
    `cli_dropin` (exercises the real CLI binary on purpose), `diff_kotlinc`/`diagnostics_match_kotlinc`
    (kotlinc differential). NOTE: `range_step`/`secondary_ctor_noprimary` previously hard-asserted krusty
    compile success; via the helper a compile failure now flows to the `None`-skip branch (consistent with
    the rest of the suite's "skip-on-unsupported"), a slight loosening to revisit if either regresses.
  - Heavy tier (was ~220–290s): the full `cargo test`. PROFILED — the cost is NOT kotlinc (1–6 spawns,
    compile-once-batched) but (a) the conformance gate (~38s, optimal) and (b) the execution e2e — now
    being moved onto the P8 persistent runner. nextest (installed) parallelizes binaries; the gate
    saturates the cores. Remaining gap to full-suite <60s: convert `suspend_e2e` (the big one) onto the
    same runner.
- kotlinc 2.4.0 runs on JRE 25 (verified). bytediff is slow (one kotlinc JVM launch per file) — sample.

## Phase log

(newest first — every entry = a committed+pushed phase, gate FAIL=0)

- **Phase P16 — synthesized accessor `Signature`s for type-parameter properties (gate 1492, FAIL=0).** A
  generic class's synthesized property accessors over a type-parameter field now carry their JVM
  `Signature`: `getA()` → `()TT;`, `setA(T)` → `(TT;)V` (no `<…>` prefix — they USE the class's `T` but
  declare none; `jvm_type_params` returns `""` for an empty type-param list). Verified byte-identical to
  kotlinc. `ir_lower` records an `IrGenericSig` (empty `type_params`) per accessor fid in
  `IrFile.signatures`; the existing `emit_method` path formats it. Generic-class byte-parity now covers
  class + fields + getters/setters; the only remaining piece is the synthesized `<init>` `(TT;)V`. Tests:
  `generic_signature_e2e`. (Landed via worktree branch — `master` was being force-pushed; see
  [[feedback-never-bypass-hooks]].)
- **Phase P15 — field `Signature` for type-parameter-typed fields (gate 1491 → 1492, FAIL=0).** A field
  whose declared type is a bare type parameter (`class Pair<A, B>(val a: A, val b: B)` → fields `a`/`b`)
  gets a JVM field `Signature` (`TA;`/`TB;`), like kotlinc — verified byte-identical. `ClassWriter` gained
  `FieldInfo.signature` + `add_field_sig` + serialization (the `Signature` attr name interned when a field
  OR method uses it). Backend-agnostic (P14 design): `ir_lower::class_field_tparams` records `(field,
  type-param name)` in `IrFile.field_signatures`; the JVM backend formats `T<name>;`. Also captured
  `classreader::FieldSig.signature` (already parsed, was discarded). NEXT: synthesized ctor/getter
  signatures (kotlinc signs `<init>` `(TA;TB;)V`, `getA()` `()TA;`). Tests: `generic_signature_e2e`.
- **Phase P14 — class-level generic `Signature` + move signature FORMATTING to the JVM backend (gate
  1491, FAIL=0).** (a) ARCHITECTURE FIX (owner-flagged): P12/P13 built JVM descriptor strings inside
  `ir_lower`, coupling the backend-agnostic IR to the JVM target ([[feedback-platform-decouple]]). Now
  `ir_lower` only EXTRACTS a backend-agnostic `ir::IrGenericSig` (type-param names + bounds as Kotlin
  `IrType`; which params/return are bare type-param refs); the JVM backend (`ir_emit::jvm_method_signature`
  / `jvm_class_signature` / `jvm_bound_descriptor`) formats the `Signature` string. (b) NEW: generic
  CLASSES emit a class `Signature` (`class Box<T>` → `<T:Ljava/lang/Object;>Ljava/lang/Object;`) via
  `ClassWriter::set_signature`. Function + member + class signatures verified byte-identical to kotlinc;
  gate 1491/0. Landed on branch `phase-signatures` (the shared `master` working tree was being
  concurrently reset, wiping source — see [[feedback-never-bypass-hooks]]). NEXT: field signatures.
- **Phase P13 — generic member methods: scope own type params + emit `Signature` (gate 1491, FAIL=0).**
  Two coupled fixes: (1) CORRECTNESS — a member method's return type referencing the method's OWN type
  parameter (`class Box { fun <U> wrap(u: U): U }`) was rejected "unresolved reference 'U'": the signature
  collector resolved member-method RETURN types under the class's type params (`ctp`) only, not the method's
  (`mtp = ctp + method params`) — the params path already used `mtp`, only the return pre-pass didn't. Now
  generic member methods compile + run. (2) BYTE-PARITY — extended P12's `Signature` emission to member
  methods (`fun <U> wrap(u: U): U` → `<U:Ljava/lang/Object;>(TU;)TU;`, verified identical to kotlinc). Net
  gate unchanged (those box tests carry other co-blockers), but member generic methods are now correct +
  byte-faithful. Tests: `tests/generic_signature_e2e.rs` (member compile+run+signature).
- **Phase P12 — generic `Signature` attribute emission (byte-parity; gate 1491, FAIL=0).** Closes part of
  the systemic byte-parity gap: krusty emitted NO generic `Signature` attribute; kotlinc emits one for
  every type-parameterized declaration (the descriptor erases type params, the Signature preserves them).
  Now a type-parameterized top-level FUNCTION emits a JVM `Signature` — `fun <T> id(t: T): T` →
  `<T:Ljava/lang/Object;>(TT;)TT;`, `fun <T: Int> idi(t: T): T` → `<T:Ljava/lang/Integer;>(TT;)TT;`
  (bound uses the boxed wrapper even though the descriptor is specialized `(I)I` from P10/P11) — VERIFIED
  byte-identical to kotlinc's signature strings. ClassWriter (`classfile.rs`) gained `MethodInfo.signature`
  + `add_method_sig` + serialization (the `Signature` attr name is interned only when used, so non-generic
  classes are unchanged). The signature string is generated in `ir_lower::fn_jvm_signature` from the AST
  (type params + bounds + param/return refs) and carried via `IrFile.signatures` (fid→string); `emit_method`
  writes it. Conservative: returns `None` (omits the attr, kotlinc-divergent but never WRONG) for shapes not
  yet modeled — a type param used inside a generic argument (`List<T>`), a non-Object/non-primitive bound,
  a vararg, member/extension/local functions. ZERO runtime risk (Signature is advisory metadata) → gate
  unchanged at 1491/0. Tests: `tests/generic_signature_e2e.rs`. NEXT for full generic byte-parity: nested
  generic args (`List<T>`), class/field Signatures, member/extension functions.
- **Phase P11 — RESTORE P10's lost source + spread operator `*arr` (gate 1491, FAIL=0).** CORRECTION:
  the P10 commit `a3b10f8` was HOLLOW — it captured only `docs/` + the test file; the actual source
  (the `TParams` refactor, `is_specializable_bound`, `FunDecl.type_param_bounds`) was reverted by tooling
  before the commit, so the pushed tree was really at the P9 gate (1457) and P10's test passed *vacuously*
  (it skips when compile fails). This phase re-applies the full P10 source — verified `fun <T: Int>` →
  descriptor `(I)I` and gate back to **1491**. LESSON: after `cargo fmt`/pre-commit, always re-check
  `git diff --stat` lists the SOURCE files before committing; a green pre-push can still hide a vacuously-
  skipping test. Also adds the **spread operator** `*arr`: `foo(*a)` (single spread → a top-level vararg
  function) lowers to `Arrays.copyOf(a, a.size)` + `checkcast` — byte-identical to kotlinc (verified). A
  guard at the `Expr::Call` lowering entry routes any spread call to a focused handler; every other shape
  (mixed spreads, fixed args, member/library callee, primitive element, non-`Name` spread) returns `None`
  → the file skips, so a spread arg never reaches the normal vararg-packing paths (never miscompiles). The
  checker reports a spread arg's ELEMENT type to resolution/vararg-checking (it behaves like N varargs).
  Spread test files mostly have other co-blockers (array-literal `dup` divergence, `Array<out>` variance),
  so net gate is +0 for now, but the codegen is proven. Tests: `tests/spread_operator_e2e.rs`,
  `tests/primitive_bound_generic_e2e.rs` (now asserts for real, not vacuous).
- **Phase P10 — specialize integral primitive-bounded FUNCTION type parameters (gate 1459 → 1491, +32).**
  ⚠️ The source for this phase did NOT land in commit `a3b10f8` (hollow — see P11); it is RESTORED in P11.
  `fun <T: Int> f(t: T): T` is specialized by kotlinc to the primitive (descriptor `(I)I`, not
  `(Object)Object` — verified). krusty previously REJECTED any primitive bound. Now a FUNCTION type
  parameter with an INTEGRAL wrappable bound (`Int`/`Long`/`Short`/`Byte`/`Char`/`Boolean`) erases to
  that primitive. Introduced a `TParams` struct (name → erasure `Ty`) threaded through `ty_of_ref` and
  the `Checker` (replacing the bare `HashSet<String>`; empty/erased map = exact old behavior, so the
  1459 existing passes are untouched). `FunDecl` now stores `type_param_bounds` (was discarded). SOUND
  RESTRICTION (each enforced after a gate FAIL surfaced it): (1) only FUNCTION params specialize — CLASS
  params stay erased (`TParams::erased`), because the value-class pass owns class-bound handling and
  naive class specialization VerifyError'd 6 box tests; (2) only INTEGRAL bounds — `Double`/`Float` are
  rejected (boxed-vs-primitive `==` differs on −0.0/NaN: `eqNullableDoublesWithTP.kt`); (3) unsigned/value
  bounds stay rejected (`kt27096Generic.kt`). NON-specializable primitive bounds are re-rejected in the
  parser so the file skips, never miscompiles. NOTE: like all krusty generics, the `Signature` attribute
  is still not emitted (kotlinc emits it) — a systemic byte-parity gap, separate from this runtime win.
  Tests: `tests/primitive_bound_generic_e2e.rs` (descriptor `(I)I`, `(C)C`, run; Double rejected).
- **Phase P9 — language-feature flags + name-based `[a, b]` destructuring (gate 1361 → 1457, +96).**
  A drop-in honors the same feature toggles `kotlinc` does. Added `krusty::features::LangFeatures` (a
  set of enabled `LanguageFeature` names) sourced from `-XXLanguage:+Foo` / `-Xname-based-destructuring`
  CLI flags (via `cli::Options.features`) and from the test infra's `// LANGUAGE:` directives (the gate,
  survey, and `compile_in_process` read them). Parser gains `parse_with_features` (`parse` stays a
  zero-feature wrapper — no caller churn). First feature: `NameBasedDestructuring` — `for ([a, b] in …)`
  and `val [a, b] = …` parse exactly like the `(a, b)` forms (same positional `componentN`; proven
  byte-identical to kotlinc with `-Xname-based-destructuring=complete`). WITHOUT the flag krusty rejects
  `[a, b]`, matching default `kotlinc` ("experimental … enable explicitly"). Fixed a latent bug this
  surfaced: `lower_destructure` never boxed a mutable destructured component captured+written by a
  closure (`var [a,b]=A(); { a=3 }()`) — now boxes into a `Ref` like any captured `var` local.
  Tests: `tests/name_based_destructuring_e2e.rs` (enabled→OK, var-capture→OK, disabled→rejected) +
  `features` unit tests. KEY LEARNING (user): experimental syntax must be flag-gated, NOT supported
  unconditionally — but a drop-in DOES support every flag kotlinc accepts (so the gate enables them per
  the `// LANGUAGE:` directive). The survey/gate now parse under per-file features, de-noising the
  histogram (the old "expected loop variable" 141 was mostly `+NameBasedDestructuring`).
- **Phase P8 — persistent JVM box-runner for the execution e2e (test-time <60s work).** Added
  `tests/common::{compile_and_run_box, run_box, find_box_class, java_home}` — a shared persistent-JVM
  `BoxRunner` (the conformance gate's in-process-compile + ClassLoader/reflection pattern) so execution
  e2e tests stop spawning the krusty binary + `javac` + `java` per test. Converted 24 single-source
  `box()` e2e files to it (all green); each test now costs ~0 process launches after the per-binary JVM
  warmup. No compiler source touched — pure harness speedup. Remaining big item: `suspend_e2e`. `lower_for_each` copied the iterable into
  a fresh local before looping; kotlinc iterates on an existing local directly (only snapshots into a
  temp when the iterable is a complex expr OR its backing `var` is reassigned in the body — confirmed
  by `forIn*VarUpdatedInLoopBody` box tests). Now reuses the local unless the body reassigns it
  (`expr_reassigns_name` AST scan) — for-in-local-array is byte-identical to kotlinc. Gate 1357/0; new
  differential + shape tests in `bytecode_parity_e2e`. Baseline this HEAD (`0be2f77`): 1357 box-OK.
- **Phase P2/P3 — counted range-loop parity (`until` / `..`, unit step).** kotlinc folds a CONSTANT
  bound into a single `i < C` exclusive test (no hoisted local, no overflow guard): `1..10` → `i < 11`,
  `0 until 10` → `i < 10`. A bound that is already a plain local (`0 until n`) is read directly, not
  hoisted. The overflow break guard is emitted only where the counter can actually wrap (`..`/`downTo`,
  or any non-unit `step`) — never for exclusive `until` step-1. `for (i in 0 until 10|1..10|0 until n)`
  is now byte-identical to kotlinc. Gate 1357/0; differential + shape tests in `bytecode_parity_e2e`.
  STILL DIVERGE (follow-up): `downTo` bound-0/negative, `step k` (kotlinc's `getProgressionLastElement`).
- **Phase P4 — `downTo` constant-bound fold.** kotlinc folds constant `downTo C` to the exclusive test
  `(C-1) < i` (operands swapped: `iconst C-1; iload i; if_icmpge`), no hoist/guard. krusty now matches
  for a non-zero folded bound (`10 downTo 2` byte-identical). KNOWN follow-ups: `downTo 1` (folded bound
  `0` hits krusty's compare-to-zero opt → `ifle`, while kotlinc keeps `iconst_0; if_icmpge`; needs a
  loop-bound-specific suppression that source `0 < x` comparisons must NOT get) and negative bounds
  (const-encoding). Gate 1357/0; differential test added.
- **Phase P5 — `&&` / `||` short-circuit (CORRECTNESS + parity).** krusty lowered `a && b` (value
  context) to eager `iand`/`ior` — both operands evaluated. A real MISCOMPILE: `x != 0 && 10 / x > 0`
  threw `ArithmeticException` for `x == 0` (kotlinc short-circuits). Now lowered to a branch
  (`a && b` → `if (a) b else false`, `a || b` → `if (a) true else b`); a literal left operand is
  constant-folded (kotlinc folds `const val`s; a branch in a field initializer would otherwise produce
  an unverifiable frame — was the 1 gate FAIL the fix first introduced, now resolved). Gate 1357/0; new
  `short_circuit_e2e` runtime tests. PARITY follow-up: kotlinc re-normalizes the right operand through a
  SHARED false-target (`iload a; ifeq F; iload b; ifeq F; iconst_1; goto E; F: iconst_0`); krusty's
  nested-`When` returns `b` directly — value-equal, shape differs. Needs a shared-label boolean
  construct.
  - SUSPEND interaction: the short-circuit `When` is applied only in NON-suspend bodies. The CPS
    flattener models a suspension on the `&&`/`||` RHS only at an UNCONDITIONAL position (the old eager
    `iand` made it unconditional); the branch form makes it conditional, which the flattener doesn't
    model yet (its own doc). A non-suspend body can't call a suspend fn, so short-circuit is always safe
    there; suspend bodies keep the eager form (`cur_fn_suspend` guard) until the flattener handles
    conditional suspension. Both `short_circuit_e2e` and the suspend `&&`-condition test pass.
- _known next divergences (from `bytediff` over the corpus)_: array-literal init (`intArrayOf(…)` uses
  `dup`-per-element; kotlinc stores to a temp + `aload`-per-element); primitive-array `iterator()` loops
  (krusty ~24 bytes larger); more loop forms (ranges/downTo/step/indices) to audit for kotlinc's
  counted-loop optimizations.
